 *
 * Future endpoints to be implemented:
 * - GET /users/profile - Get current user's profile
 * - PATCH /users/profile - Update current user's profile
 * - GET /users/:id - Get user by ID (admin only)
 * - GET /users - List users (admin only)
 *
 * Note: Endpoint implementations will be added when the
 * user management features are implemented.
